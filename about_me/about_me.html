                    Hi, my name is Justin Arieltan and I am a student at KTH.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have finished my bachelor's degree in information and communications technology 
                    and am currently studying for my master's degree in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in computers started a while back when I was a younger. 
                    I have always enjoyed playing games on the computer and that sparked my interest in it. 
                    It was not until I was in high school though where I started to try out programming.
                    During one summer I decided to try to learn Python online. 
                    Although I did not understand much of the concepts, this helped me decide what I wanted to study in university.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for my hobbies, I have mentioned that I have interest in playing games, but I also enjoy watching movies and tv shows like most people.
                    I enjoy a wide range of games such as first person shooters, real time strategy, role playing games, and much more. 
                    I also enjoy playing both single player and multiplayer with friends.
                    As for movies and shows, I also watch a variety of genres although I am not as big of a fan of horror as action films.
                    Some of my favorites include Kung Fu Hustle, LÃ©on: The Professional, and Spirited Away.
                    For tv shows some examples are 19-2, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and The Wire.
                    Furthermore I enjoy cooking, especially trying out new dishes to make. 
                    I always want to try making different cuisines from around the world and to taste those great meals. 
                    Although it might be hard to find certain ingredients, it would be even harder to find a restaurant that serves that dish.
